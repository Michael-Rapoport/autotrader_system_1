Autotrading_System_1 is a comprehensive Python-based platform designed to facilitate the development, optimization, and deployment of automated trading systems. It encompasses various modules for data processing, model training, strategy backtesting, risk management, execution, and monitoring, making it a versatile tool for both beginners and experienced traders.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Fetch and preprocess raw data from various sources, including historical stock data and alternative data sources for sentiment analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implement and train advanced machine learning models, including ensemble models combining LSTM and XGBoost.
- **Strategy Backtesting**: Evaluate trading strategies on historical data with performance metrics and visualization.
- **Risk Management**: Implement position sizing algorithms, stop-loss, and trailing stop-loss order management.
- **Execution**: Integrate with Alpaca and Interactive Brokers APIs for live trading execution.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor performance and alerting system with integration to monitoring tools and notification services.
- **MLOps**: Manage data and model versioning, deployment pipelines, and model monitoring.
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utility scripts for database connections, caching, and performance optimization.
- **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for different modules and components.
- **Configs**: Configuration files for different environments and API keys management.
- **Docs**: Comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, usage guides, and API references.
- **GitHub**: CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deploying the trading bot.
- **Deployment**: Scripts and configurations for deploying the trading bot to cloud platforms.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or above (MetaTrader doesn't support their Python API on macOS or Linux)
- MetaTrader 5 (MetaTrader 4 doesn't have a Python API)
- Basic knowledge of Python, such as functions and variables
- Python 3 installed (recommended version is 3.10)
- An IDE (e.g., JetBrains Pycharm Community Edition)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new Python virtual environment to isolate the package.
3. Install the code in editable mode along with all dependencies using `pip install -e.[all]`.
4. Install pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit install`.
5. Start developing Make sure to follow the development guidelines.

## Development Guidelines

- Run `black` on any code you modify to format it according to PEP8 standards.
- Document as you go using numpy style docstrings, and add to the docs where relevant.
- Write unit tests for the code you add, and include them in `tests/`. This project uses `pytest`.
- Commit code regularly to avoid large commits with many changes.
- Write meaningful commit messages, following the Conventional Commits standard. Use `commitizen` to help with this.
- Open a Pull Request when your code is complete and ready to be merged.
